This release is expected to blend new filler-like content with nostalgic elements and modern animation quality, serving as a tribute to the franchise's legacy and a potential gateway for future Naruto projects [AnimeXNews](link), [ScreenRant](link), [CBR](link)."

**CORRECT Example (What you MUST do):**
"These episodes focus on Team 7's adventures during the pre-Shippuden era [AnimeXNews](link), featuring Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, and Kakashi [ScreenRant](link).

 - "The CEO stated expansion plans are accelerated [PressRelease](link) following board approval [SECFiling](link)"
 - "Sales in California reached $500M [StateReport](link) while Texas sales hit $400M [TexasReport](link)"

### Non-Negotiable Rules:

- **NEVER write more than 3-4 words without a citation if making factual claims**
- **Break every compound sentence into multiple sentences with individual citations**
- **Each number, company name, location, or specific detail gets its own citation**
- Provide the locations mentioned in the web page by analyzing or extracting it from the webpages.
- **If you group citations together, you are failing this task completely**
